Python scripts to plot Poincare maps near each of the indicated TNOs
using the files in the data directory. The resulting plots are in the
plots directory.

Each script has the observed best-fit semimajor axis (varaible abf),
the 1-sigma uncertainty in semimajor axis (variable da) and psi value
(variablle obspsi; the difference in mean longitude between Neptune 
and the object) at the epoch of the object's most recent (or near 
future) perihelion passage (variable tp). These match the values in 
Table 1 of Volk & Malhotra 2022.


You can update these variables with new orbit fits for the TNOs by
editing the appropriate variables in each python script to see how 
improvements to the orbit affect a TNO's potential resonant status.
